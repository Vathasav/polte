# Etherpad deployment demo

*This is still a work in progress and the description below might not be up to
date (yet)*

This repository contains Ansible playbooks for deploying Etherpad with a Galera
backend using Heat and Docker. This is mainly meant to be an example on how to
use these tools together, but you could also potentially use this to deploy an
Etherpad application on OpenStack.

## Requirements

* Ansible >= 2.2
* shade >= 1.8.0
